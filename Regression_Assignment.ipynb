    "            Random residuals → Good model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Curved residual pattern → Model underfits; increase polynomial degree.\n",

    "            Increasing spread of residuals → Heteroscedasticity; may need transformation.\n",

    "            If a training curve follows data well but a test curve is highly different, it signals overfitting."
